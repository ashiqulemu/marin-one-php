                    Mobile app development presents unique challenges compared to building a feature-rich website as the App Store and Google Play Store have compliance requirements that might affect your app that could prevent it from getting approved for sale on the stores. Apps are a competitive landscape and knowing the latest trends in product psychology and design patterns help make your app ‘stick’ with your users is important as well. We take all of this into account, and put ourselves in the shoes of you and your customers when taking a human-first philosophy towards app development.

                    When building a mobile app as an established business, our first task is to analyse your business requirements and determine the best tech-stack we can bring to the table. Is native iPhone or Android development right for you? Or, is there a path to solving your problem with a cross-platform mobile app, or perhaps even a responsive web-app to keep costs down and deploy your solution to more devices at once?
