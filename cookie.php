This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to. The information does not usually directly identify you, but it can give you a more personalized web experience. Because we respect your right to privacy, you can choose not to allow some types of cookies. Click on the different category headings in our cookie banner to change our default settings.

                This Cookie Statement explains how Ezzha and its group companies (collectively “Ezzha”, "we", "us", and "ours") use cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our websites. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

                Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on the Ezzha Website. Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Ezzha) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

                We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our websites to operate, and we refer to these as "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our websites. Third parties serve cookies through our websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.

                These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
