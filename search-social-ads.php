                    Not the keyword but target the person- Paid advertising campaigns on social networks offer distinct advantages compared to traditional pay-per-click (PPC) on traditional search engines. Social media advertising allows you to isolate people with specific jobs, skills, associations, age, gender, interests, hobbies, locations and much more. With social media advertising campaigns, you target the searcher, not the search term, allowing you to better target the specific audience that you want to reach.
