        A website is a brand touchpoint, a business tool, and a place to drive critical conversions. A great website can be an engine of business growth. A poor site can inflict damage on your brand.
But outstanding web design isn’t easy. Today’s audiences have high expectations. You have seconds – maybe milliseconds – to convince visitors that your site is worth their time.
In that case here is EZZHA with its expert team to build sites to perform with a focus on strategic planning, compelling visual design, and flawless user experience, in order to drive superior results.

                    A tactical strategy aligns the website’s proposed structure, content, and features with business goals. It’s the point to agree where we make high-level decisions about the direction of the website.
During strategy on apart, an experienced website strategist collaborates with UX, design, and content specialists to conduct research, identify challenges and opportunities, and make recommendations. At the end of the phase, we present a strategy document that guides the creation of the website and sets the tone for your project.

                    At planning stage, Ezzha’s information architects and UX designers bring out a described strategic direction that refers to a blueprint for the site. 
The first key of deliverable is a sitemap, which express to shown up a detailed of the structure and hierarchy of the site’s pages. Next come wireframes – low-fidelity, black and white designs that show each page template’s essential structure. All of these deliverables are reflected by as much user research as we can conduct perfectly.

                    At design stage- the hard work really starts to pay off to gain its belongings. We begin with an empiric exploration – as the name suggests, we explore a range of possibilities with demand, getting a feel for how to represent a required brand. Some of the clients have their strict brand guidelines, while others are looking for guidance on how to define or reimagine their brand – we’re equally comfortable working with both.
The deliverables for the design phase are full-colour mock-ups of each template, which build on the wire frames created during planning. Each mock-up is presented to your team for detailed feedback as we go, starting with the homepage. And since a fully responsive design is non-negotiable, we design separately for desktop, mobile, and tablet, optimizing every element and interaction for each device.

                    Everyone writes but not everyone can write for the web. Ezzha’s copywriters know how to write concisely that demands for the proper impact to capture ever-shrinking attention spans. We also know how to make a story unfold and make pages flow. We can keep imaginary thought in mind like a first-time site visitor, and make a page attractive to variant viewers and search engine bots alike. And we’ll dive deep into product features, service offerings, and more to find a message that resonates.

                    If we build your site first and “doing SEO” later, that can result in missing vital opportunities or put existing equity at risk. 
For that reason, each website we design is building with SEO front of mind. Our SEO specialists can stay with up-to-date involvement throughout the project to help ensure we create the right pages in the right places. Sitemaps, wireframes, copy, and even design elements are carefully reviewed to ensure that all contents/feature can discoverable, relevant, and follow SEO best practices.
